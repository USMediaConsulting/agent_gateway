The Bidder Gateway is a service that sits in front of https://github.com/rtbkit 's 
Agent Configuration Service and provides a RESTFul API that masks and extends the 
later's functionality. It's core motivation is to provide an easy way to start and 
stop bidders through a web app. So, what's easier than a RESTful API ?
